# Challenge-Portfolio

##Description

In this bootcamp challenge, students were tasked with creating a webpage portfolio with no pre-set code. Through the challenge, students learned how to create an entire HTML and CSS code from scratch, organize and display personal information and work of the student, commit with clear and concise messages, as well as deployment. The finished product will showcase the student and their work, and responds with adapting viewpoints.
